### Git for Windows: git bash

When using git bash within [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), the scripts can simply be put in `usr\bin` in the installation directory.
That directory usually is `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`.

1. Download a zip package from the [releases page](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/releases)
2. Unzip the package
3. Copy everything from `src/` into `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`

### Linux subsystem

The scripts work in the Bash on [Ubuntu on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6), the Linux-subsystem that officially supports Linux command line tools.
Make sure that you have [installed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) the Linux-subsystem, run `bash` on the command line and follow the instructions in the "From a Release Package" section above.

Autocomplete
----------
In order to have autocomplete on the commands, add the `autocomplete/adr` script to your `/etc/bash_autocomplete.d` or the equivalent to your platform.
